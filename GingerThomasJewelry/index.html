        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>At the age of 16, our owner, Nicole Donovan, founded our first sustainable jewelry line using recycled materials. It all began with a vacation to the USVI, discovering her love for the island’s style of necklaces and the simplistic island-beachy look. With the importance of not wasting materials in mind, she realized it was easy to create her own jewelry using pieces recycled, giving a unique and one-of-a-kind piece of jewelry.</p>
